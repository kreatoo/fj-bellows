### Managed firewall (`firewall:` block)

When the `firewall` block is set, fj-bellows creates **one Cloud Firewall per
deployment** (keyed by `cfg.Tag`), attaches every provisioned worker to it,
and cleans it up when the last worker is destroyed. The firewall has a
default-deny inbound posture: only tcp/22 from the resolved `allow_inbound`
CIDRs. Outbound is unrestricted (workers need HTTPS to Forgejo, registries,
etc.).

`allow_inbound` (and the `addresses:` field on `extra_inbound` /
`extra_outbound` rules) accept literal CIDRs plus a unified set of sentinels:

| Token | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `<cidr>` | itself |
| `auto` | host's external IPv4 (`/32`) and IPv6 (`/128`), via icanhazip |
| `any` | `0.0.0.0/0` + `::/0` |
| `any-v4` | `0.0.0.0/0` |
| `any-v6` | `::/0` |

The sentinel vocabulary is the same across both surfaces — `auto` lets an
extra rule track the operator's IP (e.g. an SSH allow-from-here rule on a
non-standard port), and `any[-vN]` is the natural shorthand for a
permissive rule (e.g. an `extra_outbound` DROP-from-anywhere block).

Sentinel resolution is **fatal at Configure** (startup) — a sentinel that
can't resolve or an `allow_inbound` that ends up empty makes the daemon
refuse to start, rather than silently provisioning workers nobody can
reach. The refresh goroutine handles drift after that: every
`refresh_interval` it re-resolves the sentinels and updates the firewall
rules if they changed. Runtime refresh failure is non-fatal — the
previous-known-good ruleset stays in place; the daemon stays usable.

Stateful conntrack on Linode firewalls means in-flight SSH sessions from
the old IP aren't killed by a rule swap; only future connections are
gated.

**PAT scope** for managed mode: `Linodes: Read/Write` **and** `Firewalls:
Read/Write`. The simpler `firewall_id` mode below only needs `Linodes:
Read/Write`.

#### Policy overrides + extra rules (`inbound_policy`, `outbound_policy`, `extra_inbound`, `extra_outbound`)

The defaults — `inbound_policy: DROP`, `outbound_policy: ACCEPT` — are right
for the common case (workers accept only inbound tcp/22 from `allow_inbound`,
and need unrestricted outbound for HTTPS to Forgejo, registries, package
mirrors). The optional knobs cover the cases the defaults don't fit:

- **`inbound_policy: ACCEPT`** flips to default-allow on inbound. Don't use
  this unless `extra_inbound` lists every port you want to block — workers
  with default-allow inbound and only your synthesized SSH rule are
  effectively wide open. A misuse this way is a bigger footgun than the
  default.
- **`outbound_policy: DROP`** forces an explicit egress allow list. Workers
  must still reach Forgejo (over the dispatcher's reverse-tunnel; see #33),
  the runner-version download (`code.forgejo.org`), and whatever package /
  image registries the workflow uses (Docker Hub, GHCR, apt/yum mirrors).
  Set this only with `extra_outbound` rules listing every required egress —
  an over-tight outbound list stops the worker from booting.
- **`extra_inbound` / `extra_outbound`** add rules verbatim in the linodego
  shape. Each rule's `addresses.ipv4` and `addresses.ipv6` are capped at 255
  entries (the Linode per-rule limit); the combined inbound rule count
  (synth + extras) must stay under the 25-rule-per-firewall ceiling, same
  for outbound on its own.

The refresh goroutine only re-resolves the `allow_inbound` sentinels; the
operator's extras + policies are read once at Configure and never reloaded
on the running daemon. Restart to pick up edits to those fields.

**Label / tag**: the firewall is labelled `fj-bellows-<sanitize(cfg.Tag)>`
(truncated to Linode's 32-char cap with a SHA-256 suffix when needed) and
tagged with `cfg.Tag`. Lookup uses the tag — labels are for human
inspection.

**IP-literal Forgejo URLs** (e.g. `https://192.0.2.10/`): the
hostname-override piece in the dispatcher doesn't apply (see #37); this is
unrelated to the firewall mode and not a managed-firewall limitation.

### `firewall_id` — attach to an operator-managed firewall

When `firewall_id` is set to a non-zero integer, every Linode created by
this provider is attached to that Cloud Firewall at create time
(`InstanceCreateOptions.FirewallID`). The firewall itself — its rules and
lifecycle — is operator-managed out of band; fj-bellows only attaches to it.

PAT scope: attaching an existing firewall via `firewall_id` on instance
creation only requires the standard `Linodes: Read/Write` scope. The Linode
API treats `firewall_id` as an attachment-by-reference parameter on
`POST /linode/instances` and does not require any `Firewalls` scope. We do
not list, create, or modify firewalls in this mode.

### Managed placement group (`placement_group:` block)

When the `placement_group` block is set, fj-bellows creates **one Linode
Placement Group per deployment** (keyed by `cfg.Tag`'s label), attaches
every provisioned worker to it, and reaps the group when the last worker
is destroyed. The affinity type is `anti_affinity:local` (the only value
Linode accepts today) — workers spread across distinct hosts within the
region, so a single hardware failure doesn't take out the whole pool.

```yaml
provider_config:
  # ...
  placement_group:
    # Optional. flexible (default) lets Linode fall back to colocation
    # when no compliant slot is available; strict refuses the Provision
    # instead.
    enforcement: flexible
```

**Enforcement**:

- **`flexible`** (default): when Linode can't satisfy the anti-affinity
  constraint (host pool exhausted, etc.), it places the Linode on a
  shared host anyway. Best-effort isolation; never blocks a worker boot.
- **`strict`**: refuses the create when the anti-affinity slot isn't
  available. Provision returns an error; the orchestrator surfaces it
  and retries next tick. Use when the isolation guarantee matters more
  than worker availability.

**PAT scope** for managed mode: `Linodes: Read/Write` **and** `Placement
Groups: Read/Write`. The simpler `placement_group_id` mode below only
needs `Linodes: Read/Write`.

**Label**: `fj-bellows-<sanitize(cfg.Tag)>`, truncated to Linode's 64-char
PG label cap with a SHA-256 suffix when needed. Unlike Cloud Firewalls,
placement groups have no `tags` field — ownership matching is by label
alone. Two deployments with distinct `cfg.Tag` get distinct labels →
distinct groups.

**Lifecycle**:

- Eager create at Configure (mirror of managed firewall — PAT-scope
  mistakes surface at startup).
- No refresh goroutine; PG policy + label can't drift the way an
  external IP can.
- Last `Destroy` in a deployment triggers `maybeCleanupPlacementGroup`
  via the same per-instance Destroy path that reaps the firewall. The
  PG is deleted once `GetPlacementGroup.Members` is empty (Linode
  auto-unassigns destroyed instances from their group).

### `placement_group_id` — attach to an operator-managed PG

Mutually exclusive with `placement_group`. Mirrors `firewall_id`: every
provisioned worker is attached to the named group at create time, and
fj-bellows does nothing else. No extra PAT scope.

The group's region must match `region:` above (Linode rejects the
attach otherwise).

## VPC

Optional. Stands up a Linode VPC for the deployment and attaches every
provisioned worker to a configured subnet (in addition to its public NIC).
Useful on its own for worker-to-worker private comms; designed to also
host the pull-through registry cache (FJB-6) so the cache binds to a VPC
IP and is unreachable from the public internet.

### `vpc:` — managed mode

```yaml
provider_config:
  region: us-ord
  # ...
  vpc:
    # At least one subnet required. CIDRs must be RFC1918 (10/8,
    # 172.16/12, 192.168/16) — Linode rejects CGNAT (100.64.0.0/10)
    # and public ranges with `400 [subnets[N].ipv4] The subnet ... is
    # not in the allowed VPC ranges`. CIDRs don't escape the VPC, so
    # any vacant RFC1918 range works — pick one that doesn't overlap
    # your LAN if you ever VPN/peer.
    subnets:
      cache:
        ipv4: 10.0.0.0/24
    # Optional. Defaults to the alphabetically-first subnet key.
    # worker_subnet: cache
```

When `vpc:` is set, fj-bellows creates **one VPC per deployment** (keyed
by `cfg.Tag` via the VPC's label) with the configured subnets, attaches
every worker's second NIC to the resolved `worker_subnet`, and reaps the
VPC plus its subnets when the last worker is destroyed.

**Worker attachment**: workers get an explicit two-NIC config —
`{public, primary} + {vpc, subnet_id}`. The public NIC stays primary so
default-route egress is unchanged (workers still pull from upstream
registries and package mirrors over the public network). Removing the
public NIC would require an out-of-VPC NAT, which is out of scope.

**Subnet naming**: subnets are keyed by name in the YAML; the Linode
label is `fj-bellows-<sanitize(cfg.Tag + "-" + name)>`. Two deployments
using the same subnet name (e.g. both `cache`) don't collide because
`cfg.Tag` is in the label.

**PAT scope**: managed VPC adds `VPCs: Read/Write` on top of the existing
`Linodes: Read/Write`. (`firewall:` adds `Firewalls: Read/Write`,
`placement_group:` adds `Placement Groups: Read/Write` — they stack.)

**Labels**: VPC labels are restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9-]` (no underscores
or dots, unlike firewalls and PGs). The sanitizer replaces disallowed
chars with `-` and truncates over-long labels with a SHA-256-derived
suffix so two distinct long tags don't collide. Override the
auto-derived label with `vpc.name: <label>` when running multiple
deployments that need distinct human-readable VPC names.

**Lifecycle**:

- Eager create at Configure — same rationale as firewall + PG (PAT-scope
  mistakes surface at startup, not on the first job arrival).
- Adopt-existing on restart: if a VPC with the matching label already
  exists in the region, fj-bellows reuses it and creates any subnets
  declared in config that aren't yet present on it.
- Last `Destroy` in a deployment triggers `maybeCleanupVPC` via the same
  per-instance Destroy path that reaps the firewall + PG. The VPC and
  all its subnets are deleted once every subnet's `Linodes` field is
  empty — Linode reports per-subnet attachment counts on `GetVPC`, so
  cleanup is graph-aware and won't race a still-attached worker.

### Operator-managed VPC mode

Not yet supported. The shape is non-trivial (operator has to supply both
the VPC ID and the per-worker subnet ID, and there's no obvious "managed
subnets within an operator-managed VPC" story to factor in). Would
mirror `firewall_id:` / `placement_group_id:` as `vpc_id:` +
`vpc_subnet_id:` if added later.

## Cache (FJB-6 PR 2a + PR 2b)

Optional. Stands up a [zot](https://zotregistry.dev/) registry as a
pull-through cache backed by Linode Object Storage, with workers
wired to pull through it.

### `cache:` — managed mode

```yaml
provider_config:
  region: us-ord
  # ... firewall: / placement_group: as before ...
  cache:
    # Required. Workers' containerd mirror config keys on the host of
    # this URL; zot's sync extension pull-throughs from this URL.
    upstream:
      url: https://forgejo.example.com/v2/
    # Optional. CA persistence path (load-or-generate) — daemon
    # restart with the same CA dir lets fj-bellows adopt the existing
    # cache VM instead of recreating it. Default: under
    # os.UserConfigDir() namespaced by the deployment tag.
    # tls:
    #   ca_dir: /var/lib/fj-bellows/<tag>/cache-ca
    # Optional VM tuning (all default):
    # type: g6-nanode-1            # bump to g6-standard-1 under burst pulls
    # image: linode/debian12
    # zot_version: 2.1.7           # pinned; bump deliberately
```

When `cache:` is set, fj-bellows:

1. **Auto-synthesizes the `vpc:` block** with a single `cache` subnet at
   `10.0.0.0/24` if you didn't declare one. Workers gain a VPC NIC on
   the same subnet (see VPC section above). Declare `vpc:` explicitly
   to override the CIDR or add more subnets.
2. **Mints an Object Storage bucket** named `fjb-cache-<tag>` in the
   provider region.
3. **Creates a scoped Object Storage access key** limited to that bucket
   (read_write). The secret is exposed by Linode exactly once at create
   time and lives in the cache VM's user-data; the orchestrator never
   persists it.
4. **Provisions a separate Linode** (default Nanode) tagged
   `<deployment-tag>-cache` (NOT the deployment tag — the worker
   `List(tag)` lookup is exact-match, so the cache never surfaces as a
   worker the reconciler tries to dispatch to). Its cloud-init downloads
   the pinned zot binary, generates a self-signed TLS cert with openssl,
   writes `/etc/zot/config.json` pointing at the bucket, and starts the
   `zot.service` systemd unit on port 5000.
5. **Attaches the cache to the deployment firewall and VPC** — the
   firewall's default `allow_inbound: [auto]` covers SSH; tcp/5000 is
   reachable only over the VPC NIC (the public NIC's firewall drops
   non-SSH inbound).

The cache VM uses the SAME deployment firewall as workers — no separate
firewall block. Operators get SSH break-glass via the operator's IP
(per the `auto` sentinel); registry traffic stays off the public NIC.

### PAT scope

`cache:` adds **Object Storage: R/W** on top of:
- `Linodes: R/W` (always required)
- `Firewalls: R/W` (when `firewall:` is set)
- `Placement Groups: R/W` (when `placement_group:` is set)
- `VPCs: R/W` (when `vpc:` is set OR auto-synthesized via `cache:`)

### Linode account prerequisites

Object Storage must be **enabled on the account** ($5/mo flat,
one-click at Cloud Manager → Object Storage → "Enable Object Storage").
Without it, `cache:` Configure fails at the first `CreateObjectStorage*`
call with a Linode 403 — the error surfaces immediately at startup
(eager-create), not on first job. A dedicated pre-probe with a
clearer error message lands in PR 2b.

### Lifecycle

- **Eager create at Configure** — same rationale as firewall + VPC.
  Order: firewall → PG → VPC (auto or explicit) → cache.
- **Adopt-existing on restart**: if a cache VM with the matching
  `<tag>-cache` tag already exists, fj-bellows adopts it and skips
  bucket + key creation entirely. The existing VM keeps its baked-in
  credentials and stays serving. Daemon restarts therefore don't churn
  the cache.
- **Reap on last Destroy**: the cache VM gets `DeleteInstance` on the
  last worker teardown. The Object Storage key follows. The bucket
  itself is **not** deleted — cached layers are typically valuable
  across deployments, and Linode's `DeleteObjectStorageBucket` rejects
  non-empty buckets with a 400 anyway. A `retain_after_destroy` knob
  with explicit force-empty semantics lands in PR 2b.
- **Stale-key reaping**: at Configure, fj-bellows lists Object Storage
  keys whose label matches the deployment pattern and reaps any
  left-over keys from prior daemon lifetimes (rationale: Linode reveals
  `secret_key` only once at create, so any prior-lifetime key is
  unusable to the new daemon).

### Worker integration (PR 2b)

When `cache:` is set, the linode provider wraps each worker's
cloud-init in a multipart-MIME message whose second part is a
deployment-specific fragment that:

- Trusts the **fjb-managed CA** — written to
  `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/fjb-cache.crt` and registered via
  `update-ca-certificates`. The CA is generated once and persisted to
  `cache.tls.ca_dir` so daemon restarts adopt the existing cache VM
  (signed by the same CA).
- Adds an `/etc/hosts` entry: `<cache VPC IP> cache.fjb.internal`.
  No DNS dependency — the hosts lookup wins. The VPC IP is looked up
  from the cache linode's config interfaces on first Provision after
  Configure and cached for the daemon's lifetime.
- Installs a containerd `hosts.toml` for the configured upstream host
  with **pull-only capabilities** (`["pull", "resolve"]`, NOT
  `"push"`). This is the boundary that keeps
  `docker push <upstream-host>/foo` going direct to upstream over the
  public NIC — the cache is a target only for explicit pushes to the
  cache hostname. Without this, push traffic would be silently
  captured by the cache and never reach the upstream registry.

The provider-side multipart wrap keeps the `bootstrap` package and
the orchestrator unaware of provider-specific cache concerns — they
render the standard worker cloud-init, the linode provider's
Provision adds the cache fragment on top. cloud-init merges the two
parts (write_files and runcmd entries from both are concatenated).

When `cache:` is unset the wrap is skipped entirely and worker
cloud-init is byte-identical to a no-cache deployment.

### TLS and CA persistence

The fjb-managed CA persists to `cache.tls.ca_dir` across daemon
restarts. Operators running fjb as a system service should set this
to a stable path (e.g. `/var/lib/fj-bellows/<tag>/cache-ca/`); the
default falls back to `os.UserConfigDir()` which is `~/.config/...`
on Linux when running under a user account.

Three outcomes at Configure-time:

1. **CA dir empty, no cache VM**: generate fresh CA, persist it,
   create cache VM signed by it. Workers trust the new CA.
2. **CA dir populated, no cache VM**: reuse persisted CA, create
   cache VM signed by it. (Typical "daemon restart after manual
   cache VM teardown".)
3. **CA dir populated, cache VM exists**: adopt the cache VM. CA on
   disk matches the one that signed the VM's baked-in cert; workers
   keep trusting it. (Typical "daemon restart with intact state".)

A fourth case — **CA dir empty, cache VM exists** — is detected and
rejected with a clear error. The operator picks: restore the CA
backup, or destroy the cache VM and let the next start recreate it
under the fresh CA.

### Upstream reachability — orchestrator reverse-tunnel (FJB-7)

The cache VM lives on Linode and reaches the operator's upstream
registry through a **persistent `ssh -R` tunnel from the
orchestrator**, not directly. This is what makes a LAN-internal
upstream (`https://git.stern.ca/v2/` on `192.168.x.x`, split-horizon
DNS, etc.) usable without exposing it on the public internet.

How it composes:

1. The cache VM cloud-init pins `127.0.0.1 <upstream-host>` in
   `/etc/hosts` and writes
   `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/20-fj-bellows-tunnel.conf` to keep
   `AllowTcpForwarding yes` (a hardened base image setting it to
   `no` would silently break sync).
2. After Configure creates the VM (or adopts an existing one), a
   long-lived orchestrator goroutine dials the cache VM over SSH
   (TOFU host-key pinning, same shape as the dispatcher's worker
   pin), opens a remote port-forward listener on
   `127.0.0.1:<upstream-port>` on the cache VM, and bridges each
   accepted connection to `<upstream-host>:<upstream-port>` from the
   orchestrator's own network namespace.
3. zot's sync extension dials `https://<upstream-host>/...`, the
   `/etc/hosts` override sends it to loopback, the listener forwards
   it through SSH to the orchestrator, the orchestrator dials the
   real upstream over its LAN/public route, and bytes flow.

TLS SNI stays the original hostname, so a public-CA cert on the
upstream continues to validate end-to-end on the cache VM.

The goroutine reconnects with exponential backoff (1s → 30s) and
shuts down cleanly on cache cleanup (last Destroy) so the loop
doesn't churn against a destroyed VM. Lifecycle matches the
managed-firewall refresh loop: `context.Background`-rooted, no
Provider.Shutdown hook required.

**IP-literal upstreams** (`https://10.0.0.5/v2/`): the `/etc/hosts`
override is skipped — /etc/hosts maps names not IPs, so loopback
redirection can't be done that way. The tunnel still starts but zot
will dial the IP directly and fail for LAN-internal IP literals.
Use a hostname upstream when the LAN-internal route matters.

**Pre-conditions**: the SSH key the dispatcher uses
(`cfg.ssh.private_key_file`) is plumbed into the linode provider via
`SetSSHIdentity` from `cmd/fj-bellows`; its public half is injected
into the cache VM's `authorized_keys` via cloud-init so the dial is
accepted. Deployments without an SSH key (e.g. docker-only) never
reach this path; deployments with cache disabled never start the
tunnel.

### Operator-managed cache mode

Not supported and not planned. Cache is a multi-resource bundle (VM +
bucket + key + cloud-init); the operator-managed shape would have to
own all three and the lifecycle coordination is non-trivial. Use the
fully-managed mode or none.

- **Provision** — `CreateInstance` with the rendered cloud-init passed as
  base64 user-data via the Linode Metadata service, the orchestrator's public
  key injected, and the pool tag stamped. Returns the instance with the
  provider-reported `CreatedAt` (which anchors the billing-hour timer).
- **Destroy** — `DeleteInstance`.
- **List(tag)** — lists instances and filters by tag.
- **BillingModel** — `BillingHourlyRoundUp` (Linode bills whole hours rounded
  up), so the core warm-holds and applies the `:55` teardown rule.

cloud-init is provider-agnostic and rendered by `internal/bootstrap`; this
package only forwards it as user-data.
